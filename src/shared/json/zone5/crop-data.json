Expensive seed makes it easier to justify the cost with longer durations (2 to 6 summers) and for harvesting forage. Cut for hay or clip occasionally to keep vegetative and maintain stand.  For hay, 1st cut at bud stage, next cuts every 30-40 days (late bud to ¼ bloom), last cut in fall in time for 8” regrowth. Dormant in winter; select varieties with appropriate winter hardiness for your area and mix with cool-season perennial grass (e.g., orchardgrass) or overseed with annual grass (e.g, wheat) for winter cover and to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with a nurse crop  of spring oats or small grains at low rate that will be harvested/mowed off to release perennial understory.

Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill.",

Resists some problem nematodes, good taproot. Moderate to excellent N fixation depending on planting timing. Excellent forage, blooms for pollinators. For fall-seeding, use multi-cut medium or one-cut mammoth varieties. Multi-cut “medium” types best for spring planting. Avoid seed set by harvesting regularly at 1/4 - 1/3 bloom. Mix with grasses like orchardgrass or fescue to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with spring oat nurse crop at low rate in fall or small grain that will be harvested/mowed to “release” clover understory. Inoculate with appropriate Rhizobium spp.; cross inoculates with crimson or white clover. Slower growing, must be seeded earlier and killed later than other fall-seeded legumes. ",

One of the best cover crop species for interseeding due to ease of establishment under droughty conditions, shade tolerance, and short stature. Annual ryegrass is a key weed in small grains. Do not allow to set seed. Can be hard to kill with herbicides and other methods; successful termination dependent on crop growth stage and application timing. Blends of annual ryegrass that mature at different times will make termination more difficult. Mixes well with crimson clover. Shorter than small grains with a lower C:N ratio. ",

Maturity can vary by variety, with ‘Purple Bounty’ maturing early. Residues release N fast. Good forage. Host to some problem nematodes. Small grain producers should use caution because of its tendency to volunteer and climb subsequent small grains (i.e. it can reduce yield, foul harvest equipment, and contaminate harvested grain). Hard seed can be nullified by scarification prior to planting. Mixes especially well with a rye cover crop; climbs small grain in mixes. Inoculate the seed with appropriate Rhizobium spp.; cross inoculates peas.",
