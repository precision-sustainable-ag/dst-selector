Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms.

Resists some problem nematodes, good taproot. Moderate to excellent N fixation depending on planting timing. Excellent forage, blooms for pollinators. For fall-seeding, use multi-cut medium or one-cut mammoth varieties. Multi-cut “medium” types best for spring planting. Avoid seed set by harvesting regularly at 1/4 - 1/3 bloom. Mix with grasses like orchardgrass or fescue to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with spring oat nurse crop at low rate in fall or small grain that will be harvested/mowed to “release” clover understory.

Large N fixation potential.  Effectively suppresses root-knot nematodes. Low weed risk, but with enough time can set viable seed. Becomes stemmy as it matures. Inoculate seed; cross-inoculates with cowpea. Certain cultivars contain alkaloids which are poisonous to livestock; check before feeding to animals. Spindly growth habit with narrow leaves seems to make it a better choice for mixes than in monoculture. Mix with sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and sunflower for a diverse warm season mixture.  ",
