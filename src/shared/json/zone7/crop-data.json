For hay, 1st cut at bud stage, next cuts every 30-40 days (late bud to ¼ bloom), last cut in fall in time for 8” regrowth. Dormant in winter; select varieties with appropriate winter hardiness for your area and mix with cool-season perennial grass (e.g., orchardgrass) or overseed with annual grass (e.g, wheat) for winter cover and to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with a nurse crop  of spring oats or small grains at low rate that will be harvested/mowed off to release perennial understory.

Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate.

Many varieties are available; use late-maturing or forage cultivars for high biomass. Its bushy growth habit mixes better with short grasses like foxtail millet. Similar to cowpea for cover crop use. Attractive to deer so not recommended for areas with high deer pressure. Compared to cowpea: more tolerant of cool weather, wet soils; less tolerant of drought, pests, poor soil fertility.","Zone Inclusion":["Zone 6","Zone 7","Zone 5","Zone 4"],"__id":"recHg1SDIyM7cFLaT"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f74ed239ae3ba4815e4e103"},"Cover Crop Name":"Sunn Hemp","Scientific Name":"Crotalaria juncea","cv, var, or ssp to specify":"(look up Steve Groff's CV that does well here)","Origin":"MCCC Species tool","Drought Tolerance":4,"Shade Tolerance":2,"Flood Tolerance":2,"Low Fertility Tolerance":4,"Salinity Tolerance":2,"Winter Survival":["Never"],"Active Growth Period":["Summer"],"Duration":["Annual"],"Shape & Orientation":["Erect"],"Notes: Basic Agronomics":"Dry matter highly dependent on planting and termination date and precipitation.

Fall growth is upright, similar to wheat, so it is slower to provide ground cover and weed suppression than rye. High biomass yield potential is slightly higher than wheat in the fall and similar to rye. Matures later than rye, a little later than wheat. Plant height at heading is shorter than rye. Therefore, spring residue is easier to manage than rye and (assuming same kill date), C:N ratio will be slightly lower than rye. Triticale feed quality is generally better than rye, but not as good as wheat (i.e. chop triticale for silage at boot stage). Does not easily sustain frost damage. Winter triticale varieties typically require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may stay short and not produce seed if planted in the spring. Spring triticale varieties do not require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may be less cold hardy than winter triticale varieties if planted in the fall.
