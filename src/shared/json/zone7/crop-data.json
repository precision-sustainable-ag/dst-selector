Good drought tolerance once established. Excellent legume hay crop, very deep taproot, excellent N fixer. Expensive seed makes it easier to justify the cost with longer durations (2 to 6 summers) and for harvesting forage. Cut for hay or clip occasionally to keep vegetative and maintain stand. For hay, 1st cut at bud stage, next cuts every 30-40 days (late bud to ¼ bloom), last cut in fall in time for 8” regrowth. Dormant in winter; select varieties with appropriate winter hardiness for your area and mix with cool-season perennial grass (e.g., orchardgrass) or overseed with annual grass (e.g, wheat) for winter cover and to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with a nurse crop  of spring oats or small grains at low rate that will be harvested/mowed off to release perennial understory. Inoculate seed with the appropriate Rhizobium spp.; cross-inoculates with sweetclover.",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Upright small grain. Widely used in the Northeast. Best small grain for drought, heat, salty, or alkaline soils. Not suitable for wet or acid soils. Winter barley typically needs vernalization (overwintering) to produce stalk/head/seed. May stay short and fail to flower if planted in spring. Quick growth and high biomass if fertility is good. Good weed suppressor, N scavenger, forage producer. Retains feed quality after heading. Good nurse crop for legumes. Use care when including as a cover crop in a small grain rotation (host for same diseases and pests). Bloom timing and height match crimson clover, rapeseed when used in a mix. Planted earlier in fall, matures earlier in spring than wheat. More winter-hardy than oat, less than wheat and rye. Better fall growth and tillers more than wheat and rye but more prone to frost damage.",

Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill. ",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Most commonly-grown cover crop in the US. Most winter-hardy cover crop. Best winter cover for low-fertility or acid soils. Tolerates wet soil. Winter cereal rye requires vernalization (overwintering) to flower and will likely fail to flower if planted in spring. Best winter cover for many purposes: excellent for biomass, N scavenging, weed control. Good forage, but low quality after heading. Best choice for roller-crimping. Height, biomass, high C:N ratio at maturity may hinder the growth of a following non-legume cash crop. Potential weed if it sets seed, especially in small grain cash crops. Mixes well with legumes. Can plant later than any small grain, but goes to head early in spring – only barley is earlier. ",
    "Notes: Weeds": "Can become a weed if tilled at wrong stage;  Best if killed early; Not recommended before corn; Mow-kills after heading",
    "Notes: Forage and Grazing": "Can be lightly grazed in the fall and again in the spring, or harvested in the spring as ryelage.",

Moderate to excellent N fixation depending on planting timing. Excellent forage, blooms for pollinators. For fall-seeding, use multi-cut medium or one-cut mammoth varieties. Multi-cut “medium” types best for spring planting. Avoid seed set by harvesting regularly at 1/4 - 1/3 bloom. Mix with grasses like orchardgrass or fescue to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with spring oat nurse crop at low rate in fall or small grain that will be harvested/mowed to “release” clover understory.

Contains the most bio-toxic compounds, best brassica for bio-fumigation in zones with sufficient heat accumulation to support high biomass production (requires soil incorporation, etc.). Potential for fast fall growth and high biomass with good soil fertility. Well-documented for deep N scavenging in fall. Not known for subsoiling, some varieties may not have a taproot. Winter-hardiness, day-length response, other characteristics vary widely by cultivar. If planted in the spring, may bolt (flower) before it can produce much biomass. Does not form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Host for insects of many related cash crop species used in vegetable crop production. ",

Good for suppressing weeds. Winter-killed residues decompose and release N rapidly. May overwinter in unusually warm winters in zone 7, or if snow cover is present to buffer temperature extremes. Plant early (by early September in USDA hardiness zone 7) and plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate for large plants that are more likely to winter-kill. Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly.  Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions. Plant in mix with a winter-hardy grass such as cereal rye if N leaching over winter/early spring is a concern. Has vigorous top growth and a thicker root than oilseed radish, is slower to bolt when planted in the fall. Unpleasant sulfur-smelling odor can be released as plants decay.",

Do not allow to set seed. Can be hard to terminate in the spring with herbicides and other methods; successful termination dependent on crop growth stage and application timing.

    "Cover Crop Description": "Tall tropical legume. Plant in early summer; does not tolerate cool soils. Good forage potential in areas with sufficient heat. Will tolerate high mowing (> 18\"). Large N fixation potential.  Effectively suppresses root-knot nematodes. Low weed risk, but with enough time can set viable seed. Becomes stemmy as it matures. Inoculate seed; cross-inoculates with cowpea. Certain cultivars contain alkaloids which are poisonous to livestock; check before feeding to animals. Spindly growth habit with narrow leaves seems to make it a better choice for mixes than in monoculture. Mix with sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and sunflower for a diverse warm season mixture. ",

    "Cover Crop Description": "A cross between rye and wheat, with characteristics intermediate between the two. Fall growth is upright, similar to wheat, so it is slower to provide ground cover and weed suppression than rye. High biomass yield potential is slightly higher than wheat in the fall and similar to rye. Matures later than rye, a little later than wheat. Plant height at heading is shorter than rye. Therefore, spring residue is easier to manage than rye and (assuming same kill date), C:N ratio will be slightly lower than rye. Triticale feed quality is generally better than rye, but not as good as wheat (i.e. chop triticale for silage at boot stage). Does not easily sustain frost damage. Winter triticale varieties typically require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may stay short and not produce seed if planted in the spring. Spring triticale varieties do not require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may be less cold hardy than winter triticale varieties if planted in the fall. ",
    "Notes: Forage and Grazing": "Let it go through til May and you get decent silage yields. Not quite as high as fall rye, but spring conditions are typically better for harvest by then (2 weeks after rye is ready).  Bloat risk and other animal health risks, similar to brassicas.",

Maturity can vary by variety, with ‘Purple Bounty’ maturing early. Residues release N fast. Good forage. Host to some problem nematodes. Small grain producers should use caution because of its tendency to volunteer and climb subsequent small grains (i.e. it can reduce yield, foul harvest equipment, and contaminate harvested grain). Hard seed can be nullified by scarification prior to planting. Mixes especially well with a rye cover crop; climbs small grain in mixes. Inoculate the seed with appropriate Rhizobium spp.; cross inoculates peas.",
