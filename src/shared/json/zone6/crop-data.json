Can plant later than any small grain, but goes to head early in spring – only barley is earlier. Rye is reported to be allelopathic and may inhibit both weeds and following small-seeded cash crops. Height, biomass, high C:N at maturity can be overwhelming. Best choice for rolling. Potential weed if sets seed, especially in small grain cash crops. Good forage, but low quality after heading. Mix with vetch, pea. Descr. modified from C. Lawrence, VA NRCS Cover Crop Planning Manual.\n",

Compared to barley: planted later in fall, matures later in spring, tolerates wetness better (but not flooding), higher spring biomass potential (but requires high fertility). Very good N scavenger. Top quality forage. After well-timed grazings can still produce spring biomass or grain. Fine nurse crop for legumes. Mixes well with winter peas, hairy vetch. Shorter, slower to head means residue easier to manage than rye. Not for small grain cash crop rotations (host for same diseases and pests). Descr. modified from C. Lawrence, VA NRCS Cover Crop Planning Manual.\n",

    "Notes": "Brassicas are excellent N scavengers but will winter-kill and release N potentially long before a cash crop is present. If N scavenging is goal, plant in mix with species that overwinters. Forage turnips don't typically form bulbs; bloat and animal health risk if grazing, as with other brassicas. Bulb-forming type turnips can be stored for forage, but lifters and washing equipment are needed to do so. ",
