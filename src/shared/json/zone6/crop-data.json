Prefers light to medium textured well drained soils and performs poorly on heavy, wet, or compacted soil. Fine root system good for topsoil conditioning, but not subsoiling. Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill.\n",

Contains the most bio-toxic compounds, best brassica for bio-fumigation in zones with sufficient heat accumulation to support high biomass production (requires soil incorporation, etc.). Potential for fast fall growth and high biomass with good soil fertility. Well-documented for deep N scavenging in fall. Not known for subsoiling, some varieties may not have a taproot. Winter-hardiness, day-length response, other characteristics vary widely by cultivar. If planted in the spring, may bolt (flower) before it can produce much biomass. Can be a good alternative to buckwheat for weed suppression - slower to flower. Does not form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Host for insects of many related cash crop species used in vegetable crop production. \n",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Also known as Austrian Winter Pea. Vining cool-season annual. Variable winter hardiness. Excellent N-fixer, good biomass and forage. Low risk of reseeding and becoming a weed. Susceptible to sclerotinia crown rot, rotate with non-susceptible crops to reduce risk. Inoculate the seed with appropriate Rhizobium spp; cross inoculates with vetch. If the goal is overwintering, select cultivar accordingly; avoid planting too early or late, and plant at the deeper end of the recommended planting depth range (~2\" deep). May be planted in spring, but potentially slower growth and lower biomass and N fixation than spring peas. Mixes well with upright species due to its vining habit. Residue decomposes rapidly and releases N faster than vetch. \n",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Also known as Daikon or tillage radish. Excellent fall-planted choice if winter-kill is desired. Fastest-growing fall cover crop option if good fertility is present. Good for suppressing weeds. Winter-killed residues decompose and release N rapidly. May overwinter if snow cover is present to buffer temperature extremes. Plant early and plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate for large plants that are more likely to winter-kill. Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly.  Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions. Plant in mix with a winter-hardy grass such as cereal rye if N leaching over winter/early spring is a concern. Has vigorous top growth and a thicker root than oilseed radish, is slower to bolt when planted in the fall. Unpleasant sulfur-smelling odor can be released as plants decay.\n",

With good fertility, fastest-growing fall cover option. Top biomass, subsoiler, N-scavenger, forage. Winterkilled residues disappear and N releases fast. Top weed suppressor.

Winter-hardiness can vary – select cultivar accordingly. Dense fibrous root system, top soil conditioner, good weed fighter and N scavenger, top-quality forage. Needs N fertility for high biomass. One of the best cover crop species for interseeding due to ease of establishment under droughty conditions, shade tolerance, and short stature. Annual ryegrass is a key weed in small grains. Do not allow to set seed. Can be hard to terminate in the spring with herbicides and other methods; successful termination dependent on crop growth stage and application timing. Blends of annual ryegrass that mature at different times will make termination more difficult. Mixes well with crimson clover. Shorter than small grains with a lower C:N ratio.\n",
    "Notes: Goals": "Italian ryegrass is a biennial; needs vernalization to set seed and reliably winter kills in some areas, hence the nickname \"annual ryegrass.\" There are true annual ryegrasses: these are called Westerwolds. They do not have a vernalization requirement to set seed, so management is needed to prevent volunteers. Cultivar matters hugely when using ryegrass as a cover crop because it affects the likelihood of winterkill and how challenging it will be to manage in rotation.",

Good forage, but prussic acid and nitrate content can be a problem. Slow drydown will limit dry hay production; chop or wrap for forage. Improved forage types available, cultivars may vary widely. Can produce large amount of biomass; mow or kill in a timely fashion. Can substitute forage sorghum or sudangrass. Can substitute sorghum or sorghum-sudangrass.

Small grain producers should use caution because of its tendency to volunteer and climb subsequent small grains (i.e. it can reduce yield, foul harvest equipment, and contaminate harvested grain). Hard seed can be nullified by scarification prior to planting. Mixes especially well with a rye cover crop; climbs small grain in mixes. Inoculate the seed with appropriate Rhizobium spp.; cross inoculates peas.\n",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Common cover crop. Needs vernalization (overwintering) to flower. Not likely to produce seed and will stay shorter if planted in spring. Very good N scavenger. Excellent quality forage. After well-timed grazings can still produce spring biomass or grain. Not for small grain cash crop rotations (host for same diseases and pests). Fine nurse crop for legumes. Mixes well with winter peas, hairy vetch. Shorter, slower to head means residue easier to manage than rye and doesn’t compete with legumes as vigorously in sprong. Planted later in fall, matures later in spring, tolerates wetness better (but not flooding), higher spring biomass potential (but requires high fertility) than barley.\n",
