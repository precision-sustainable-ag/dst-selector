Prefers light to medium textured well drained soils and performs poorly on heavy, wet, or compacted soil. Fine root system good for topsoil conditioning, but not subsoiling. Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill.",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Also known as Daikon or tillage radish. Excellent fall-planted choice if winter-kill is desired. Fastest-growing fall cover crop option if good fertility is present. Good for suppressing weeds. Winter-killed residues decompose and release N rapidly. May overwinter if snow cover is present to buffer temperature extremes. Plant early and plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate for large plants that are more likely to winter-kill. Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly.  Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions. Plant in mix with a winter-hardy grass such as cereal rye if N leaching over winter/early spring is a concern. Has vigorous top growth and a thicker root than oilseed radish, is slower to bolt when planted in the fall. Unpleasant sulfur-smelling odor can be released as plants decay.",
    "Notes: Goals": "Brassicas are excellent N scavengers but will winter-kill and release N potentially long before a cash crop is present. If N scavenging is goal, plant in mix with species that overwinters.",

Early planting plus light seeding rate for large lush\nplants and better winterkill. Late planting plus heavy seed ratefor smaller plants that are more winter-hardy. With good fertility, fastest-growing fall cover option. Top biomass, subsoiler, N-scavenger, forage. Winterkilled residues disappear and N releases fast. Top weed suppressor. Good in mixes, but can outcompete mixture companions. Different growth pattern if spring seeded. Substitute oilseed radish. Descr. modified from C. Lawrence, VA NRCS Cover Crop Planning Manual.",

    "Cover Crop Description": "Common cover crop. Needs vernalization (overwintering) to flower. Not likely to produce seed and will stay shorter if planted in spring. Very good N scavenger. Excellent quality forage. After well-timed grazings can still produce spring biomass or grain. Not for small grain cash crop rotations (host for same diseases and pests). Fine nurse crop for legumes. Mixes well with winter peas, hairy vetch. Shorter, slower to head means residue easier to manage than rye and doesn’t compete with legumes as vigorously in sprong. Planted later in fall, matures later in spring, tolerates wetness better (but not flooding), higher spring biomass potential (but requires high fertility) than barley.",
