              (NECCC). Our mission is to support and promote the adoption of
              cover crops and foster the exchange of information, inspiration,
              and outcome-based research. Decision support tools are an
              excellent way to integrate the complexity of climate, soil, and
              management into recommendation systems. Therefore, we first
              targeted the development of a species selection tool. This tool
              provides cover crop species recommendations based on grower USDA
              hardiness zone and cropping system specifics. Our species
              selection tool was adapted from the Midwest Cover Crop Council and
              modified and expanded to target needs of producers in the
              Northeast. This initiative led to the formation of a Species
              Selector product team consisting of agronomists, informatics
              researchers, and developers, as well as four Cover Crop Data
              Verification teams, consisting of approximately 35 NECCC members.

              data represent the collective knowledge and experience of cover
              crop experts in the Northeast US. Experts, grouped by their USDA
              hardiness zone, evaluated each cover crop property in the dataset
              via deliberative discussions in over 70 teleconferences. The
              zonesâ€™ decisions on cover crop characteristics, notes regarding
              nuances and edge/special cases, and framing of ratings were
              recorded in an online database. A comparative analysis of the data
              across zones identified areas of inconsistencies which were then
              addressed in a deliberative intra-regional discussion. This
              process, in conjunction with feedback from users on the website,

              <b>Reusability:</b> We designed the user interface components of
              the Cover Crop Species Selector Tool to be reusable. Each user
              interface component is composed of smaller components that can be
              duplicated and used in a variety and multiple contexts. For
              example the location component is used in two parts of the species
              selector: the wizard -- the place the user first selects their
              location, and the green bar -- the place the user can update their
              location. The location component is made of other small
              components, including a map, buttons, menus, and input fields.
              These smaller components are also used in other components. For
              example, the zone selection menu is used in the location component
              and in the Cover Crop Explorer. By creating and utilizing reusable
              components, we have created a consistent user experience and user
              interface that can be carried over to future Decision Support
              Tools designed by this team.

                <strong>Steven Mirsky </strong>is a Research Ecologist in the
                USDA ARS Sustainable Agricultural Systems Lab (Beltsville, MD).
                His research program focuses on removing barriers to cover crop
                adoption and increasing the precision of their use with emphasis
                on management, breeding, and subsequent agro-ecosystem services.
                As chair of the NECCC and decision support tool subcommittee
                (2016 to present), he led the development of the NECCC Species

                Researcher in the Agricultural Informatics Lab at Purdue
                University. Her research explores and addresses
                information-based barriers to sustainable agricultural
                practices. She was responsible for the implementation of the
                data verification process and underlying data structures. She
                also directed the implementation of the user interface design
                and ensured that it appropriately represented the cover crop
                data that powers the tool.&nbsp;
