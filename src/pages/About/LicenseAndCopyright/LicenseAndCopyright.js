      The data featured in this tool are based on expert opinion. These data represent the
      collective knowledge and experience of cover crop experts in the Northeast US.
      Experts, grouped by their USDA hardiness zone, evaluated each cover crop property in
      the dataset via deliberative discussions in over 70 teleconferences. The zonesâ€™
      decisions on cover crop characteristics, notes regarding nuances and edge/special
      cases, and framing of ratings were recorded in an online database. A comparative
      analysis of the data across zones identified areas of inconsistencies which were then
      addressed in a deliberative intra-regional discussion. This process, in conjunction
      with feedback from users on the website, ensures the quality and improvement of the
      data that powers the NECCC Species Selector. You can learn more about the

      We are in the process of making our data publicly available
      via a few mechanisms once we have completed beta-testing and finalized data quality
      checks. In addition to accessing this data via the NECCC Species Selector Tool, users
      will be able to download the raw data (spreadsheets) and Species Information Sheets
      (PDFs).
